if __name__ == "__main__":  # true if this file NOT imported
    app.debug = True        # enable auto-reload upon code change
    app.run()

# we now know that it is printing the nme of the module, and that __main__ means that the file is NOT imported; debugger will also only turn on if file is not imported
# prediction was correct
