K11 -- Some Things Never Change
SUMMARY:
10-06-2021

Predictions:
- app will run hello_world() and have debug mode on, since file is imported
- will return "No hablo queso!" which you will see on the webpage
- will print out "the name of this module is..." and then will print out the name of the module (__main__ in this case)

After running, our predictions were all correct.
