0. This syntax reminds me of Java, where we initiate object with a class.
1. "/" is how the computer separate path directories and it is easy to see this in the terminal or html websites
2. I think it'll print in terminal once the server starts. 3. It says it'll print __name__ so I assume it's the name corresponding to the Flask element.
3. I believe it print on the webpage once the server runs because I have prior experience in flask.
4. This reminds me of functions that certain objects have in Java

notes:
- it printed out __main__ in the terminal which I didn't realize was the value of __name__.
- I did have prior experience in flask so I am a bit familiar with what is happening.
